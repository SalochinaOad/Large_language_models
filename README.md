# LangChain Learning Notebooks
This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks designed to teach LangChain concepts step-by-step, from basic prompt handling to advanced functional conversations. Each lesson builds upon the previous one, helping you gain practical, hands-on experience with LangChain’s core features.

Learning Path
L1 – Model Prompt Parser
Learn how to send prompts to models, parse responses, and handle structured outputs.

L2 – Memory
Understand how to store and retrieve conversational context for building stateful applications.

L3 – OpenAI Functions
Explore how to integrate OpenAI function calls into LangChain workflows for structured, automated responses.

L4 – LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)
Get familiar with LCEL syntax for chaining together models, tools, and workflows.

L5 – Function Calling
Implement function calling within LangChain to execute external logic or APIs directly from model outputs.

L6 – Tagging and Extraction
Learn how to tag, extract, and structure data from unstructured model responses.

L7 – Tools, Routing, and APIs
Practice connecting LangChain with external tools and APIs, including routing requests to the right functions.

L8 – Functional Conversation
Build multi-step, interactive conversations that combine memory, tools, and function calls for complex tasks.

How to Use
Follow the notebooks in sequence for a smooth learning experience.

Run cells step-by-step to understand each concept.
